"""SingleController: asyncio orchestrator for the RL training loop.

CPU-only Ray actor that runs two concurrent pumps plus a watchdog, and
coordinates the other actors via lightweight RPCs. SC sends control signals
and reads metadata only — model tensors still move through DataPlane or NCCL.

Data flow:
  _rollout_pump  → gen.generate_and_push(prompt, dp_client) ← RPC to GenWorker
                     GenWorker → dp_client.put_samples(...)
  _train_pump    → sampler.evict/select against TQReplayBuffer
                 → _value_stage(meta) (PPO only) → value.get_values_from_meta(...)
                     Value → dp_client.get/put_samples(...) (via its own client)
                 → _advantage_stage(meta) → dp_client.get_samples(...)
                                        → adv_estimator.compute_advantage(...)
                                        → dp_client.put_samples(...)
                 → _value_train(meta) (PPO only) → value.train_from_meta(...)
                     Value → dp_client.get_samples(...)     (via its own client)
                 → trainer.begin/train_microbatches/finish_train_step (split API,
                     driver-side TQPolicy via asyncio.to_thread)
                     Trainer → dp_client.get_samples(...)   (via its own client)
                 → dp_client.clear_samples(...)             ← SC clears after train
  _sync_weights  → WeightSynchronizer.sync_weights()
