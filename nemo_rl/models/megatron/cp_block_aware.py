"""Block-aware context parallelism (stage (b)) plumbing for diffusion GRPO.

Stage (b) of ``plans/cp_kv_sharding_blockaware_ring.md`` gives the noisy and
clean sections of the ``[noisy | clean]`` layout one zigzag each instead of one
global zigzag, so the noisy K/V -- only ever consumed block-diagonally -- never
leaves its owning rank and only the clean K/V is all-gathered.

The per-rank row SET differs between the two layouts (at cp=2 the single-zigzag
rank 0 holds the noisy first half plus the clean second half, while the
segmented rank 0 holds noisy chunks {0,3} and clean chunks {0,3}). That is a
cross-rank difference, not a local permutation, so it cannot be absorbed inside
attention: the data sharding, the attention layer, the target-id slicing and the
logprob re-gather must all agree, or they silently disagree about which token
sits at which row.

This module is the single place that decides whether the segmented layout is in
play, so those call sites cannot drift apart. The flag is the same environment
variable the Megatron-Bridge attention layer reads, for the same reason.
