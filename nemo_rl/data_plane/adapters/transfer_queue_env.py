"""Mooncake engine environment, configured *before* the engine is imported.

Mooncake snapshots its whole ``MC_*`` configuration as its extension loads, so
these variables only take effect if they are in ``os.environ`` beforehand. That
makes import order load-bearing, and the failure is silent: a late write lands
in ``os.environ`` — where it still reads back correctly — while the engine keeps
the value it captured. On a rail-isolated RoCE fabric that silence costs a run,
with every transfer dying as "transport retry counter exceeded".

This module therefore deliberately imports **nothing** from ``transfer_queue``
or ``mooncake``, so importing it can never be the thing that loads the engine.
Keep it that way — a convenience import here, or one added to this package's
``__init__``, would defeat the whole point. :func:`configure_engine_env` turns
the ordering violation into an error rather than a silent misconfiguration.
