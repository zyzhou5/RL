"""Stable boundary between NeMo-RL and data-plane implementations.

Wire shape adapters must support:
  * ``fields``: ``TensorDict`` with tensor leaves AND optional
    ``NonTensorStack`` / ``NonTensorData`` leaves (TQ-native non-tensor
    passthrough). TQ's storage backends handle encoding per backend
    (simple keeps Python objects; mooncake_client pickles internally).
  * ``tags``: ``list[dict[str, Any]]`` per-sample primitives (kept
    separate from ``fields`` so non-tensor metadata like
    ``input_lengths`` doesn't pollute the leaf-level schema).
  * ``keys``: per-sample string uids.
  * ``partition_id``: string-named address spaces with declared
    ``consumer_tasks`` and ``fields`` schemas.

All call sites in ``nemo_rl/algorithms``, ``nemo_rl/experience`` and
``nemo_rl/models`` go through :class:`DataPlaneClient` — never
``import transfer_queue`` directly. This is what makes the
implementation swappable.

See ``nemo_rl/data_plane/README.md`` for the full design.

    RDMA that memory is pinned and resident from setup, so keep the per-node
    product in mind when raising them. Under-sizing surfaces as
    ``batch_get_tensor returned None``.

    ``reuse_registered_buffers`` keeps a pool of RDMA-registered buffers alive
    instead of registering a fresh one per transfer; set false to fall back to
    upstream's per-call registration.

    ``staging_buffer_size`` is that pool's per-slot ceiling. It is a pooling
    threshold, not a size limit: a bigger payload still transfers, just with a
    transient registration. Slots ratchet — they grow to the largest payload
    admitted and never shrink — so raise it only when a per-key payload (one
    sample of one field) genuinely exceeds it, not for headroom.

    ``use_gdr`` selects TransferQueue's GPUDirect RDMA path. Its single
    ``gdr_staging_buffer_mb`` CUDA staging buffer is separate from the CPU
    registered-buffer pool above; it is allocated lazily per eligible client
    process. A zero-sized CUDA buffer intentionally falls back to CPU RDMA.

    Every RDMA rail on the host is offered to mooncake (see ``rdma_devices``).
    That is only safe with ``MC_ENABLE_DEST_DEVICE_AFFINITY=1``, which pins each
