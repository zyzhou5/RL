# Router Replay

Router Replay, or R3, records MoE router choices made during rollout generation
and replays those choices in Megatron forward passes. This keeps each generated
token's expert assignment consistent across rollout, logprob, and training
stages. Without replay, two valid router implementations can choose different
experts for the same token, which introduces train-vs-rollout logprob mismatch
that is unrelated to the policy update.

Router Replay is disabled by default. It is not needed for dense models. In
the current NeMo RL integration, Router Replay is wired and tested for
Megatron MoE policy training with vLLM rollout generation. Other
inference/generation backends are not wired into this path and have not been
tested with Router Replay.

## Configuration

Set `policy.router_replay.enabled=true` in the training config:

```yaml
policy:
  router_replay:
    enabled: true
```

When Router Replay is enabled, NeMo RL configures vLLM rollout generation to
return routed expert indices by setting `enable_return_routed_experts=True` in
the vLLM kwargs. The generation payload is then carried through the normal
rollout and policy data path as the `routed_experts` field.

An example recipe is available at:

```

## Validation

Router Replay validation covers two end-to-end questions:

1. whether rollout routes are carried through TransferQueue, packing, context
   parallel slicing, and Megatron replay without changing token identity;
2. whether matched R3-on runs reduce train-vs-rollout mismatch relative to
   matched R3-off controls.

### Trace Debugging

Router Replay can emit JSONL traces for a small number of training steps. This
is intended for correctness debugging, not long training runs.

| Environment variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `NRL_R3_TRACE` | `0` | Master switch for R3 JSONL trace emission. |
| `NRL_R3_TRACE_STEPS` | `1` | Number of training steps to trace. |
| `NRL_R3_TRACE_SAMPLES` | `2` | Number of samples with full tensor previews. |
| `NRL_R3_TRACE_DIR` | `logs/r3_trace` | Trace output directory. |
| `NRL_R3_TRACE_MICROBATCHES` | `2` | Number of microbatches to trace per stage. |
| `NRL_R3_TRACE_VERIFY_FORWARD` | `0` | Verifies replayed top-k indices against the installed replay tensor during forward. |

Example:

```bash
export NRL_R3_TRACE=1
export NRL_R3_TRACE_VERIFY_FORWARD=1
export NRL_R3_TRACE_STEPS=1
export NRL_R3_TRACE_SAMPLES=1
export NRL_R3_TRACE_MICROBATCHES=1
export NRL_R3_TRACE_DIR=/path/to/run/r3_trace
```

After the run, validate the emitted trace:

```bash
python tools/check_r3_trace.py /path/to/run/r3_trace \
  --require-forward-verify \
  --require-cp-identity
```

The checker verifies that:

- rollout payload samples include both `input_ids` and `routed_experts`;
- TransferQueue fetches match the rollout payload;
- context-parallel slicing preserves token identity for routed experts;
- Router Replay assignments are installed for prev-logprob and train stages;
- forward verification reports that replayed routes match the installed tensor.

### Effectiveness Check

1. Run matched R3-off controls to check that the PR does not regress existing
   packed-sequence and context-parallel Megatron training paths.
2. Run matched R3-on/R3-off pairs to measure whether Router Replay reduces
   train-vs-rollout mismatch under the intended rollout settings.

The main metrics to inspect are:

- `train/token_mult_prob_error`
- `train/js_divergence_error`

## Other Notes

### Fallback for Missing Routes

In rare cases, vLLM can return fewer routed-expert entries than expected for a
sample. NeMo RL represents each missing token route with an all-`-1` sentinel.
Megatron then uses its normal router only for those missing token routes, while
all returned vLLM routes are still replayed exactly.

The fallback is intentionally route-local: it does not disable Router Replay for
the whole batch or sample.

When fallback is used, NeMo RL logs
`r3/routed_experts_fallback_token_route_fraction`. This metric should normally
be zero or near-zero. A nonzero value means some token routes used Megatron's
normal router instead of replay.
