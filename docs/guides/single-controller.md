# Train with Single-Controller (Async GRPO and PPO)

:::{warning}
The Single-Controller path is a **beta feature** and still under active development. The API and configuration surface are not yet stable and may change without notice. Issues and feedback are welcome — please file them at [github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/RL/issues](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/RL/issues).
:::

The Single-Controller (SC) path is an alternative async GRPO and PPO runtime that runs rollout generation and policy training as two independent *pumps* coordinated by a single Ray actor (`SingleControllerActor`) sitting over a shared TransferQueue (TQ) data plane. Compared to the legacy async GRPO in [async-grpo.md](./async-grpo.md), SC decouples per-prompt rollouts from the per-step batch boundary: producers push finished rollouts into `TQReplayBuffer` at group granularity, and a pluggable `StalenessSampler` decides which groups the trainer consumes on each step.

## Configure the Single-Controller Path

The SC path is launched via a dedicated entrypoint:

```bash
uv run examples/run_grpo_single_controller.py --config <your-sc.yaml>
```

`run_grpo_single_controller.py` mirrors `run_grpo.py` for config loading — the same YAML files apply — but requires a few settings the legacy path does not. The default exemplar lives at [examples/configs/grpo_math_1B_megatron_single_controller.yaml](../../examples/configs/grpo_math_1B_megatron_single_controller.yaml); the PPO one at [examples/configs/ppo_math_1B_megatron_single_controller.yaml](../../examples/configs/ppo_math_1B_megatron_single_controller.yaml).

### Mandatory settings

1. **Enable the TransferQueue data plane** (required — the entrypoint refuses to start otherwise):

    ```yaml
    data_plane:
      enabled: true
    ```

2. **Enable vLLM async engine** and **disable colocated inference** (SC drives rollout via `RolloutManager.generate_and_push`, which is only supported on the disaggregated async engine; setup rejects `colocated.enabled: true`):

    ```yaml
    policy:
      generation:
        backend: "vllm"
        vllm_cfg:
          async_engine: true
        colocated:
          enabled: false
          resources:
            num_nodes: 1
            gpus_per_node: 4  # inference GPUs; remainder go to training
    ```

3. **One RL step = one training batch.** The batch a step trains on is the whole step (see `validate_single_controller_config` in [nemo_rl/algorithms/single_controller_utils/config.py](../../nemo_rl/algorithms/single_controller_utils/config.py)). A GRPO step is also one optimizer step; a PPO step is `ppo.ppo_epochs` of them over that same batch.

    ```python
    num_prompts_per_step * num_generations_per_prompt == policy.train_global_batch_size
    num_prompts_per_step * num_generations_per_prompt == value.train_global_batch_size  # PPO
    ```

4. **Enable importance sampling correction** whenever the sampler admits off-policy data (any `max_staleness_versions > 0` on the `windowed`/`weight_fifo` samplers, or `max_lookahead_versions > 0` on `in_order`). The correction and its derivation are the same as for legacy async GRPO — see [Why Importance Sampling Correction Is Required for Async](./async-grpo.md#why-importance-sampling-correction-is-required-for-async):

    ```yaml
    loss_fn:
      use_importance_sampling_correction: true
    ```

5. **Save the data plane for replay recovery.** When Single-Controller checkpointing is enabled, all built-in samplers require `checkpointing.save_data_plane: true` so completed, unconsumed rollout groups survive a restart. TQ supports `simple` natively. NeMo-RL also provides an experimental, opt-in Mooncake plugin described in [TQ checkpointing with Mooncake](../design-docs/tq-mooncake-checkpointing.md). For multi-node runs, both the checkpoint directory and any Mooncake storage root must be durable filesystems visible at the same path from every node.

    ```yaml
    checkpointing:
      enabled: true
      checkpoint_dir: /shared/checkpoints/my-run
      save_data_plane: true

    data_plane:
      enabled: true
      backend: "simple"
    ```

    To use the experimental Mooncake path instead:

    ```yaml
    data_plane:
      enabled: true
      backend: "mooncake_cpu"
      mooncake_cpu:
        checkpoint:
          enabled: true
          storage_root: /shared/tq-mooncake
    ```

    Enabling it writes one live DISK replica to the shared filesystem for every Mooncake PUT/upsert and then copies all referenced payloads into each immutable checkpoint. Leave it disabled for runs that do not need data-plane recovery.

6. **(PPO) Set `ppo:` instead of `grpo:`** — the two algorithm blocks are mutually exclusive, and SC reads every step setting from whichever one is present. A PPO run also needs `value:`, `value_loss_fn:` and `ppo.adv_estimator.name: gae` (same schemas as legacy PPO), a Megatron critic, and `policy.offload_optimizer_for_logprob: true`, which is what keeps the policy optimizer off the GPU while the critic runs. `ppo.policy_training_start_step: N` gives the usual critic warmup: for the first N steps the policy is neither trained nor refit, while the critic trains every step.

## Checkpointing and Replay Recovery

With `checkpointing.save_data_plane: true`, each Single-Controller checkpoint contains:

- The normal model, dataloader, and controller state, plus optimizer state when configured.
- A TQ snapshot containing every controller-referenced payload field, including
  tensor and non-tensor values, plus TQ controller and consumption state.
- A metadata-only replay index describing the completed rollout groups stored in TQ.
- The sampler dispatch position needed to continue scheduling from the correct point.

The TQ snapshot and replay index are captured under the same checkpoint barrier. Generation may continue while the snapshot is written, but completed-group commits and destructive TQ clears wait at the barrier. This ensures that the TQ snapshot and replay index describe the same set of groups.

On resume, Single-Controller validates the TQ snapshot against the trainer checkpoint, restores the replay index, and makes completed, committed, unconsumed groups available to the sampler before training resumes.

Replay recovery is supported by all built-in samplers: `in_order`, `weight_fifo`, `ready_first`, and `windowed`. Custom samplers must explicitly declare `supports_buffer_checkpoint = True`. Otherwise, setup emits a warning and completed buffered groups are not restored.

:::{warning}
This checkpointing path recovers completed groups that have been committed to TQ. It does not recover generations that were still in flight at the checkpoint boundary.
:::

When a sampler does not support replay recovery, a requested data-plane checkpoint is written in `shadow` mode. The TQ snapshot is retained, but no authoritative replay index is written and its rows are not restored into the training replay buffer.

Mooncake save/load is advertised as supported only when `data_plane.mooncake_cpu.checkpoint.enabled: true` passes validation. The adapter requires TQ's `metadata.json.storage_saved` receipt to be true, so TQ's controller-only fallback is never accepted as a resumable data-plane checkpoint. A failure while saving or validating either backend prevents the incomplete checkpoint bundle from becoming the latest resumable checkpoint.

## Async-RL Knobs and Sampler Modes

All SC async-RL runtime knobs live under `async_rl:` in the master config. The most important choice is the `sampler`, which sets the staleness policy shared by the rollout pump (how far it may run ahead) and the train pump (which groups it may consume).

### Sampler modes

Pick one of five modes with `sampler.name`. Each mode takes its own knobs, listed below — a knob from one mode has no effect under another:

![Sampler modes: same buffer, four different training batches](../assets/sc-sampler-modes.png)

*Same buffer under trainer weight 2 (`num_prompts_per_step=2`, staleness window `[0, 2]`). `windowed` and `weight_fifo` select on `start_weight` (stamped at dispatch); `in_order` selects on `target_step` (stamped at admit). The three usually pick the same groups and diverge only when rollouts finish out of order, as drawn here.*


| `sampler.name` | Rollout gating                                                                                                          | Train selection                                                                                                   | Typical use                                                                                                  |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `in_order`     | Dispatch may lead the trainer by up to `max_lookahead_versions` batches. Each dispatch is stamped with a `target_step`. | Consume the group whose `target_step == current_train_weight`.                                                    | Sync mode (`max_lookahead_versions=0`) and legacy-async exact-batch semantics (`max_lookahead_versions>=1`). The only mode supported on a PPO run. |
| `weight_fifo`  | Same gate as `in_order` (`max_staleness_versions` of lookahead).                                                        | Drain the oldest in-window `start_weight` first, waiting for that weight's batch to fill.                         | Strict weight-version FIFO under a bounded lookahead.                                                        |
| `ready_first`  | Same gate as `weight_fifo` (`max_staleness_versions` of lookahead).                                                     | Take any ready group generated by a policy version no newer than the trainer, including late stragglers.         | Completion-order streaming without stale-group eviction.                                                    |
| `windowed`     | Ungated — rollout keeps producing until the buffer fills.                                                               | Take any ready group with `start_weight` in `[train - max_staleness_versions, train]`, optionally freshest-first. | Over-sampled streaming; aged groups outside the window are evicted (wasted compute).                         |
| `custom`       | Determined by the imported class.                                                                                       | Determined by the imported class.                                                                                 | `target: "module:ClassName"` — bring your own `PromptGroupSampler`.                                          |

Field definitions:

- `max_buffered_rollouts` — hard cap on unconsumed rollout groups buffered in the data plane. Validated at setup against the gated sampler's required capacity; a value too small deadlocks the rollout pump, so setup raises instead of silently blocking. Sized from the widest window the run ever uses, so `warmup_lookahead_versions` rather than `max_lookahead_versions` when it is set.
- `min_groups_for_streaming_train` — minimum ready groups the trainer waits for before dispatching a batch. Set to `num_prompts_per_step` for sync/legacy semantics; lower for streaming. (PPO) Must equal `num_prompts_per_step` — the critic has no split train API, so one `train_from_meta` call is one optimizer step, and streaming a step across chunks would step the critic once per chunk.
- `sampler.warmup_lookahead_versions` (PPO) — lookahead used while `ppo.policy_training_start_step` critic warmup is in progress, shrinking back to `max_lookahead_versions` afterwards. The SC equivalent of `ppo.async_ppo.warmup_generation_lead_steps`.

## Implementation Structure

The SC path splits the async-GRPO loop across a rollout pump and a train pump that share a `TQReplayBuffer` and are orchestrated by the `SingleControllerActor`.

![SC ownership and call model: driver, SingleControllerActor, and remote worker groups](../assets/sc-ownership.png)

*The driver builds every heavy object and cloudpickles it into `SingleControllerActor` (a CPU-only Ray actor). `TQReplayBuffer`, `RolloutManager`, and the sampler live inside that actor — reaching them is a direct call, not RPC. Only the generation worker group, `TQPolicy`, and the TransferQueue data plane are separate processes; the dashed arrows are the only hops that cross a process boundary.*

### Core components

#### 1. `SingleControllerActor` (`nemo_rl/algorithms/single_controller.py`)

- Single Ray actor that runs `_rollout_pump` and `_train_pump` concurrently as asyncio tasks.
- Receives a fully-constructed `SingleControllerActorArgs` (cloudpickled by the driver) — the actor does no construction work of its own, because running setup inside a nested Ray actor breaks `runtime_env` resolution. Exception: `Logger` is built inside the actor, because wandb/TB backends hold a `_thread.lock` that cloudpickle can't serialize.
- On startup, rebinds `self._rollout_manager._tq_buffer = self._buffer`. `rollout_manager` and `tq_buffer` are separate fields on the args dataclass, so Ray deserializes them as two independent buffers; without the rebind, the writer and the sampler would see different copies and the sampler would never observe committed groups.
- Pump crashes propagate to the driver; in-flight rollouts drain on exit.

#### 2. `TQReplayBuffer` (`nemo_rl/algorithms/async_utils/replay_buffer.py`)

- Group-granular replay buffer with reserve/commit slot accounting.
- `start_weight` is stamped on the slot at `reserve` (dispatch); `commit` tensorizes the group into N training-shaped rows, records `end_weight`, and flips the slot ready. Because slots are appended at reserve, buffer index order equals dispatch order and `start_weight` only ever increases down the buffer — which is why `windowed` and `weight_fifo` usually pick the same groups and diverge only when rollouts finish out of order.
- Tracks `target_step` per group when the sampler assigns one at admit time (used by `in_order`).

#### 3. `RolloutManager.generate_and_push` (`nemo_rl/experience/rollout_manager.py`)

- One entry point per prompt group: reserve a buffer slot, drive the rollout via `AsyncRolloutImpl` or `AsyncNemoGymRolloutImpl`, and commit with the observed weight versions.
- `env_handles` provide per-task environments to the rollout implementations.

#### 4. Samplers (`nemo_rl/algorithms/async_utils/staleness_sampler.py`)

- Filter-only prompt-group selector over `TQReplayBuffer`. The base `PromptGroupSampler` protocol defines `admit`, `select`, and `evict`.
- `WindowedSampler`, `ReadyFirstSampler`, `WeightFifoSampler`, and `InOrderSampler` are the built-in policies (one per row in the [Sampler modes](#sampler-modes) table). The `custom` mode (`CustomSamplerConfig.target`) makes `create_sampler` import a user-supplied class by FQN and type-check it against `PromptGroupSampler`.

#### 5. `_rollout_pump` and `_train_pump`

- `_rollout_pump`: pulls prompts from the dataloader, calls `sampler.admit`, dispatches `RolloutManager.generate_and_push`, and honours `max_inflight_prompts` as a backpressure cap.
- `_train_pump`: `sampler.evict → sampler.select → _value_stage (PPO only) → _advantage_stage → _value_train (PPO only) → TQPolicy split API (begin_train_step / train_microbatches_from_meta / finish_train_step) → dp_client.clear_samples`.

### Coordination Flow

1. **Driver setup**: `setup_single_controller` builds the worker groups, virtual cluster, dp client, dataloader, `TQReplayBuffer`, `RolloutManager`, and weight synchronizer, and packs them into a `SingleControllerActorArgs` that the entrypoint cloudpickles into the actor.
2. **Actor startup**: `SingleControllerActor` launches `_rollout_pump` and `_train_pump` concurrently as asyncio tasks; both share the same `TQReplayBuffer` and `StalenessSampler`.
3. **Rollout pump loop**: `sampler.admit` gates dispatch against the current trainer version (returning a `target_step` for `in_order`); the pump then reserves a buffer slot, drives `RolloutManager.generate_and_push`, and commits with the observed `start_weight` / `end_weight`.
4. **Train pump loop**: `sampler.evict` drops out-of-window groups, `sampler.select` picks the next batch, `_value_stage` and `_value_train` run the critic forward and its optimizer step on a PPO run, `_advantage_stage` computes advantages, and the TQPolicy split API runs one optimizer step per RL step on GRPO, or `ppo.ppo_epochs` of them on PPO.
5. **Weight sync**: after each optimizer step the pump bumps the trainer version, clears rollout permission, calls the weight synchronizer, and re-opens the rollout pump for the next version.

## Relation to Legacy Async GRPO

The [legacy async GRPO](./async-grpo.md) (`grpo.async_grpo.enabled: true` under `run_grpo.py`) and the SC path both target the same async training problem but partition responsibilities differently:


|                  | Legacy async GRPO                        | Single-Controller                                                                    |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Entrypoint       | `run_grpo.py`                            | `run_grpo_single_controller.py`                                                      |
| Data-plane       | Direct actor RPC                         | TransferQueue (`data_plane.enabled: true` required)                                  |
| Rollout batching | Full-batch `AsyncTrajectoryCollector`    | Per-prompt `RolloutManager.generate_and_push` into a group-granular `TQReplayBuffer` |
| Staleness policy | Single knob (`max_trajectory_age_steps`) | Pluggable `StalenessSampler` (`in_order` / `weight_fifo` / `ready_first` / `windowed` / `custom`) |
| Batch boundary   | Sampled by target weight                 | Sampler-defined; can decouple rollout dispatch from train batch (streaming)          |


### Migrating a legacy async config

SC reads its async knobs from `async_rl:` and **requires `grpo.async_grpo: null`** (or `ppo.async_ppo: null` on a PPO run) — `run_grpo_single_controller.py` raises if a legacy block is still present, so null it out when porting rather than leaving it in place.

| Legacy `grpo.async_grpo.*` / `ppo.async_ppo.*` | SC equivalent `async_rl.*` |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `enabled: true` | Implicit — SC is always async; use `sampler.max_lookahead_versions: 0` for sync semantics, `>= 1` for async |
| `max_trajectory_age_steps: N` | `sampler.name: in_order` with `sampler.max_lookahead_versions: N` |
| `warmup_generation_lead_steps` (PPO) | `sampler.warmup_lookahead_versions` — the lookahead to use while critic warmup is in progress |
| `recompute_kv_cache_after_weight_updates` | `recompute_kv_cache_after_weight_updates` (same) |
| `in_flight_weight_updates` | Always effectively true; `false`-equivalent behavior is not yet supported (drain-gate tracked in [issue #2625](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/RL/issues/2625)) |
| *(no legacy equivalent — matches legacy full-batch train semantics)* | `min_groups_for_streaming_train: ${grpo.num_prompts_per_step}`, or `${ppo.num_prompts_per_step}` on a PPO run |
| *(no legacy equivalent — matches legacy `max_trajectory_age + 1` batches in flight)* | `max_inflight_prompts: num_prompts_per_step × (max_lookahead_versions + 1)` |
| *(no legacy equivalent — legacy sizes its buffer to `num_prompts_per_step × max_trajectory_age_steps × 2`)* | `max_buffered_rollouts: num_prompts_per_step × (max_lookahead_versions + 1)` (tight; see the [Config → behavior map](#config--behavior-map) for per-sampler values) |

## Known Missing Features

The SC path is still under active development. Feature gaps are tracked in [issue #2625](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/RL/issues/2625). Notable items:

- Train backend: only Megatron is supported and validated; the AutoModel training path has not been tested on SC.
- Generation backend: only vLLM is supported and validated; Megatron generation, SGLang, and TRT-LLM have not been tested on SC.
- Validation is not yet supported (setup raises on `val_period > 0`, `val_at_start`, or `val_at_end`).
- (PPO) Rollout drop budgets — `async_rl.rollout_failure.max_skipped_prompts` and `max_consecutive_dropped_prompts` must both be `0`. A drop shortens the step, and the critic shards it against the configured `value.train_global_batch_size` rather than its actual size, so setup rejects a non-zero budget. The resiliency layer stays available on GRPO.
- Reward shaping and sample filtering — `overlong_filtering`, `reward_shaping`, `reward_scaling`, and `use_dynamic_sampling` are implemented on neither algorithm block, so setup rejects them rather than silently skipping the shaping.
- The `windowed` sampler has no `over_sampling_ratio` cap — over-produced groups aged past the window are evicted, wasting rollout compute.
- The drain gate in refit is not yet supported.
